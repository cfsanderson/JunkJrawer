Below are some of the many commands you may enter to move around the file. Have a play with them and see how they work.

Arrow keys - move the cursor around
j, k, h, l - move the cursor down, up, left and right (similar to the arrow keys)
^ (caret) - move cursor to beginning of current line
$ - move cursor to end of the current line.
nG - move to the nth line (eg 5G moves to 5th line)
G - move to the last line
w - move to the beginning of the next word
nw - move forward n word (eg 2w moves two words forwards)
b - move to the beginning of the previous word
nb - move back n word
{ - move backward one paragraph
} - move forward one paragraph

:set nu - turns on line numbering for the file.

x - delete a single character
nx - delete n characters (eg 5x deletes five characters)
dd - delete the current line
dn - d followed by a movement command. Delete to where the movement command would have taken you. (eg d5w means delete 5 words).

u - undo the last action (you may keep pressing u to keep undoing)
U (captial) - Undo all changes to the current file.

vi - Edit a file. Also creates the file if not already present.
cat - View a file.
less - Convenient for viewing large files.

Here is the basic set of wildcards:
